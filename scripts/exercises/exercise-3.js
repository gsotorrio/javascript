	EXERCISE 3
--------------------

	Write a function called "missingChar" which takes the following parameters:
		- text: String
		- number: Number

	Given a valid string and a number X, 
	return a new string where the char at index X has been removed.

	Example:
		- text = "Guillermo"
		- number = "5"
		- result = "Guillrmo"
		
	If the function receives a no valid string, it throws an error with the following message:
		- Error message: "Text cannot be empty"
	 
	If the number is not within the text's length range, it throws an error:
		- Error message: "Number cannot be negative or bigger than text length"
